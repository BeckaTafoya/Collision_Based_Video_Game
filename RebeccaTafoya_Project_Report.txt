WHAT ROLE YOUR CLASSES PLAY AND WHAT THEY DO:
- Ball class:
	This class creates the red ball with the flower in the center (i.e.
	the user-controlled ball. It handles it's location and displays it
	where it needs to go. It also works to continuously spin the flower
	in the center of the ball so that the ball has heirarical motion. 

- Button class:
	This class is used to create all the buttons. It tracks the mouse
	location and checks if the button needs to be illuminated. It also
	gives each button functionality upon initialization based on the 
	button_type (ex: Enter button does something different than the 
	start button). 

- Cloud class:
	This class creates the clouds, checks for collisions with the ball
	and displays the clouds in new locations. 

- EntryBox class:
	This class was used to create the Name Entry box that displays 
	on the winner screen. It allows users to click on it, then type out
	their name. Once the user presses enter, the data from the entry
	box is sent to the name column of the highScore table using the 
	ScoreHandler class.

- ScoreHandler class:
	This class downloads an .csv file with the top 5 best scores. Once
 	the player loses, it compares their score to the lowest score. If
	the player's score is higher than the lowest top score, the
 	player's score will populate the score board. The location of the
 	player's score on the score board is also determined in this class
	by going through each of the top 5 scores and determining where the
	current score lies.  

ANY UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES COMPARED TO YOUR PROPOSAL:
	There were no unexpected challenges because everything was 
	challenging as I had expected. However, I had to ask ChatGPT how to 
	create the data entry box.
